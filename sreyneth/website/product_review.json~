This seemed like a perfect targeted product that I could apply where I needed it and have it do it's job. I could not figure out how to use it without it looking very obvious on my skin. I NEVER rubbed it in and yet no matter how I applied it: tiny amounts, a bit more, brush, fingers, sponge, waiting, not waiting, over and under different types of sunscreen and foundation (liquid and powder), it looked thick and emphasized my pores.It did keep me from getting shiny though...However, I was bummed and returned it.", "Skin_Tone": "Fair", "Customer_found": "2 of 2", "About_me": "Natural Style", "Date": "1/9/2016"},

I have tried so many things to control my extremely oily skin, and nothing even comes close to being as effective as this product!  This keeps my skin from becoming oily for hours longer than anything else.  While it is pricey, a small amount goes a long way, and I don't need to blot or touch up my makeup nearly as often.  I am prone to breakouts, but have not had any trouble with this product in that regard.  Following the package directions is important, and there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to applying both this product and following up with foundation.
